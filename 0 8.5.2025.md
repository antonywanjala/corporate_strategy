My original intent in drafting this piece involved reconciling cryptography with the New Physics but, after some investigation, I found that this task would probably be best left up to Physicists and Mathematicians.

At first, after an entrepreneur arrives at a novel business model which would rely on pre-established methods of using services, services which require that a user only has access to an internet connection, power and some programming prowess, said entrepreneur would have to delineate how such a business model could thrive given the constraints associated with conventional venture funding practices, loans and the issues which may or may not arise in a fledgling organization’s pursuit of what can be described as controlled equilibrium navigation, the points between which an organization can oscillate to and from a known equilibrium point in their associated strategies and an associated point in said strategies which exists at a proximal delta from said equilibrium point and a point which represents a shift in strategies, a change which possess a magnitude represents an organization’s capacity to not exceed the use of its resources, capacity of strategy changes of an nth order. Here’s the first connection I made in this analysis: if a comparison is made to Newtonian kinematics, then it becomes readily apparent that a fledgling organization’s capacity to succeed is dependent on their having the means necessary to arrive at a nascent strategy in their respective markets and/or exchanges and reach corporate strategy escape velocity so that these organizations can soar, so to speak, as opposed to falling victim to *gravitas* associated with organizations whose prowess over metrics often associated with fundamental analysis and financial statements far exceeds their own and, as a result, the resultant *wells* in *metric-time* (akin to space-time but for the world of finance and economics) borne from this displaced prowess over organizational resources can be determined to be the leading cause of a fledgling organization’s premature failure in the wake of its inability to adapt and learn through the use of the vehicle of corporate action with the ultimate result being to either succeed or fail by achieving said corporate strategy escape velocity – the rate at which an organization’s strategy has to change in reaction to its corporate environment to leave the pull of another exchange(s) and/or corporate strateg(ies)’s influence over a common well in metric-time.

In other words, companies fail when they aren’t able to adequately reconcile strategy with corporate actions and functions. Companies succeed when they are able to properly navigate metric-time’s influence over their corporate strategies and, ultimately, actions as well. Where an instance of a corporation’s strategy can be defined as the rate at which said corporation’s functions (departments, shareholder relations, etc.) alter a metric which may be known or unknown to a corporation’s external stakeholders. To add, the rate at which said corporation’s functions alter the rate at which a metric’s rate changes, can be involved within the aforementioned strategy. For example, the rate at which an organization’s valuation changes can be deemed conceptually equivalent to velocity in kinematics with regard to metric of valuation, likewise, the rate at which an organization’s rate of valuation changes can be deemed comparable to acceleration in kinematics.

My initial inkling stemmed from the following premise: explain why it is that a corporation could only thrive provided those who knew of its founder’s strategy, could only profit from said strategy if said members kept that same strategy secret the same way a member of an exchange would keep secrets involving the inner workings of an exchange provided the success of the corporation at large’s corporate strategy was in some way dependent on that very same strategy being in the hands of a select few barring subsequent implementation of said strategy. In other words, if a corporation could only thrive if its strategy had to be kept for its success to take place, could corporate officers keep the secret? 

In other words, if the only way to profit from a corporate strategy is to keep a secret, what would be the effects of another corporation’s knowledge of said secret being used to influence strategies of their own with the intent of displacing the metric-time based values associated with said strategy’s effective use as a secret. To be more succinct, if a corporation and/or its associated strategies can be deemed comparable to a cryptographic message maker of the nth order, then what does holder of said corporation and/or corporate strategy do in the event a single message from said device is compromised. In other words, what does holder of said corporation and/or corporate strategy do in the event that the secrets which were and/or are involved with said message are no longer deemed secret? The secret-keeping corporation has two choices if they seek to remain a corporation with a potentially compromised message-maker: it can either create a message-maker that produces messages which are obfuscated by cryptography in such a way that cannot be compromised which, at this point in history, can be deemed unfeasible with enough time and/or effort on the part of the codebreaker *or* said corporation can create a new corporate strategy which incentivizes one or more parties involved (users, stakeholders and/or employees) to keep said secret *secret*, so to speak, lest said stakeholders’ respective proportion of corporate resources become compromised as well.

Furthermore, there are inherent differences in corporate strategy, where no two strategy holders are the same. Corporate strategies can be cultivated and/or maintained in much the same way conventional definitions of mastery behoove experience. Because of this, that which can hinder the practice and/or use of a corporate strategy can be deemed viable or non-viable by a given exchange(s) even if success in designating a known instance of reversal of the effects of a corporate strategy can be deemed plausible in more than one scenario(s) and/or exchange(s). These reversals are akin to failures found in conventional cryptographic message makers that have been compromised in some capacity. As though the strategy of said message-maker has undergone a reversal in overall effectiveness.

In addition, anything that can be deemed as being plausible to provoke an incumbent and/or nascent corporate strategy to change or remain the same against the will of a corporate strategist can be deemed undesirable by said strategist’s shareholders, marketing campaign, exchange, so on so forth. If there are known historical precedents which can chart a path of success between a corporate strategy at time, t, having undergone one of said undesirable hinderances, then invoking said reversals, as potential as they be, this precedent-invocation can serve the purpose of increasing a corporate strategy’s proximity toward a known equilibrium range that said strategist has at one point regarded as being comparable to or akin to a hospitable zone so as to partake in controlled equilibrium navigation, as defined earlier, within the metric-time well borne from an exchange, corporation, and/or corporate strategy’s displacement of a common resource (metric) used to evaluate said exchange, corporation, and/or corporate strategy’s success within a given exchange(s).

At certain points, effects borne from a given metric-time well, may reduce the likelihood of a participant (corporation, corporate strategy, and/or exchange which may or may not have its own agency given some programmatically-induced corporate functions) experiencing any adverse effects associated with a single instance of controlled equilibrium navigation where there can be multiple instances of controlled equilibrium navigation between two points in metric-time at two times, t1 and t2, effects which may result in long-lasting effects on a corporate strategist’s strategy writ-large, effects which may affect a participant’s proximity toward an optimal value for a given metric in a negative or positive capacity. An exchange’s effect on the metric-time well instance within metric-time is comparable to, but not the same as, the universal and/or localized effects which said participant may have on the metric-time well that said participant may share with other participants. Put simply, even though participant behavior can be explained and described with nth order differential equations, not every participant has its own agency despite there being observable changes in their behavior where corporate strategies are a prime example. To be clear, corporations and their respective strategies exist within exchanges – public or private.

When corporations don't want their corporate strategy to include a public acknowledgement (press releases, etc.) of why said corporation would leave an exchange, they will do so at a cost to shareholders whose investments may be stored within said exchange. Corporations, in an attempt to deal with potential backlash associated with corporate actions of this caliber, may necessitate the use of corporate methods that would potentially decrease the likelihood of shareholder disinterest especially if that disinterest will result in a decreased corporate valuation (among other metrics) and the associated negatives that may come as a result of said corporate actions in addition to corporate action effects on nascent and incumbent shareholder confidence in the exchange unto itself.

An exit strategy must allow an organization to achieve corporate strategy escape velocity to overcome the inward force associated with incumbent organizations remaining within an exchange which is directly proportional to the mass-equivalent associated with the largest exchange and/or organization within the gravitational well equivalent that said exchange is either a consequence of or a party to. Corporate strategy escape velocity allows for a corporate strategy (riding on the back of an organization and/or corporation, so to speak) to travel from the pull of a metric-time well to a region of metric-time which at which said corporation would no longer be *falling* into a metric-time well’s orbit given the displacement of metric-time. To put it plainly, as many corporate strategies are affected by elements of metric-time which may be outside or within a corporation’s control, corporate strategies largely influence corporate action but corporate strategies, via elements of metric-time, some elements which are outside of a corporation’s control, can be influenced by both elements within a corporation’s control and outside of a corporation’s control. That which an organization doesn’t have control over serves the purpose of informing corporate actions with great emphasis considering the uncertainty associated with these uncertain variables. Though strategies only have influence over variables at their disposal despite this paradigm.

Corporate strategy escape velocity: the rate of change which a public-facing or stakeholder-facing metric available to a given corporate strategy holder must achieve in order to leave the *pull*, so to speak, of a metric-time well.

Corporate strategies are often subject to the consequences of non-consensus among corporate officers though consensus is not impossible. Exchange-prone corporations are inherently profit-seeking, however, said organizations' definitions of profit can be defined, in part by, said organizations' shareholders and financial statements where shareholder moneys can directly influence corporate actions, moneys that can influence financial statements, financial statements that can influence said corporation's capacity to attract shareholders with those very said statements, where the ultimate goal of using those very same shareholder dollars is to increase the efficacy and reach of corporate actions, where corporate actions placate the process at large.

By making the rate at which the rate at which a given cryptographic maker to the nth order changes its proximity to achieving cryptographic equilibrium and as such the respective cryptographic continuum navigations change as well, one accommodates the likelihood that  said cryptographic script would be made akin to a metric-time corporate exchange simulation Maker of the nth order, especially in reference to cryptography's relationship to nascent and incumbent corporate strategy at the metric-time scale.

The methodologies employed by corporate strategists and their associated regulatory bodies are cyclical in nature at the micro and macro-economic level and as such corporate strategies must be crafted with a level of awareness of said cyclicality in the way they employ and curate said strategies on the open market if a strategy-holder’s intention is to counteract any potential changes which may result as a direct consequence of these cyclical methodologies being at odds with incumbent and nascent strategies currently being employed by strategists and their associated contemporaries within a metric-time well and the inherent acceleration which encourages participants subject to said acceleration to remain in orbit (so to speak) as a consequence of said acceleration and, as a result, continue to remain subject to said acceleration.

Cryptography can be used to reconcile the old physics with the new physics. In much the same way, the results of this reconciliatory effort can undergo a reconciliation of their own with game theory as it applies to corporate strategy. This means that for every analog in old and new physics, there stands to be an analog in the realm of corporate strategy.

Further Research:

What is the rate at which participant-bound strategies (pamphlets, brochures, annual reports, press releases, inter-office communications, etc.) approach a rate-of-proliferation (within a given system) of zero (equilibrium)? What is the average rate of change for participant strategies within a system at time, t? What is the rate at which the average rate of change for participant strategies approaches zero? When average participant strategy change rate reaches zero, it means that the average participant strategy changes are approaching a constant, this means that the methods invoked to affect changes to the average participant strategy or the metric associated with its success have reached a polar extreme (high, low, etc.), this means that average participant strategy has reached equilibrium (a point in which no participant is changing its strategy \- like a chemical battery \- kinematics \- reaching equilibrium). The acceleration of atoms within a battery reaches zero (t1) long before the velocity of said atoms reaches zero (t2). What is the period of time between these two points called in engineering? As an extension of this, similarities between instances of a business’s given client-facing and customer-facing strategy at any time, t, can be described with an algebraic equation (likely quadratic) then the rate at which these similarities change would be the derivative of said equation, and the rate at which these changes are enforced would be the derivative of the latter. If equilibrium is reached when acceleration reaches zero in any given system of nth order quadratic equations, what macro and micro economic forces would provoke a reduction in the proximity between the acceleration of strategy changes at any given time, t, and zero? Are any of these macro and micro economic forces influenced by a business’s client-facing and customer-facing strategies?

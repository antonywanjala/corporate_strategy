Introduction

In an attempt to find a realm of intellectual inquiry which Newtonian physics has little to no bearing on I found that the aforementioned reconciliatory effort made it abundantly clear that that there are more fields of study, especially those with a quantitative slant, which share a common lineage to and/or with kinematics than there are those which do not.

My original intent in drafting this piece involved reconciling cryptography with the New Physics but, after some investigation, I found that this task would probably be best left up to Physicists and Mathematicians.

**Impetus**

At first, after an entrepreneur arrives at a novel business model which would rely on pre-established methods of using services, services which require that a user only has access to an internet connection, power and some programming prowess, said entrepreneur would have to delineate how such a business model could thrive given the constraints associated with conventional venture funding practices, loans and the issues which may or may not arise in a fledgling organization’s pursuit of what can be described as controlled equilibrium navigation, the points between which an organization can oscillate to and from a known equilibrium point in their associated strategies and an associated point in said strategies which exists at a proximal delta from said equilibrium point and a point which represents a shift in strategies, a change which possess a magnitude represents an organization’s capacity to not exceed the use of its resources, capacity of strategy changes of the nth order. Here’s the first connection I made in this analysis: if a comparison is made to Newtonian kinematics, then it becomes readily apparent that a fledgling organization’s capacity to succeed is dependent on their having the means necessary to arrive at a nascent strategy in their respective markets and/or exchanges and reach corporate strategy escape velocity so that these organizations can soar, so to speak, as opposed to falling victim to *gravitas* associated with organizations whose prowess over metrics often associated with fundamental analysis and financial statements far exceeds their own and, as a result, the resultant *wells* in *metric-time* (akin to space-time but for the world of finance and economics) borne from this displaced prowess over organizational resources can be determined to be the leading cause of a fledgling organization’s premature failure in the wake of its inability to adapt and learn through the use of the vehicle of corporate action with the ultimate result being to either succeed or fail by achieving said corporate strategy escape velocity – the rate at which an organization’s strategy has to change in reaction to its corporate environment to leave the pull of another exchange(s) and/or corporate strateg(ies)’s influence over a common well in metric-time.

My initial inkling stemmed from the following premise: explain why it is that a corporation could only thrive provided those who knew of its founder’s strategy, could only profit from said strategy if said members kept that same strategy secret the same way a member of an exchange would keep secrets involving the inner workings of an exchange provided the success of the corporation at large’s corporate strategy was in some way dependent on that very same strategy being in the hands of a select few barring subsequent implementation of said strategy.

**Secrets and corporate strategy**

In other words, if the only way to profit from a corporate strategy is to keep a secret, what would be the effects of another corporation’s knowledge of said secret being used to influence strategies of their own with the intent of displacing the metric-time based values associated with said strategy’s effective use as a secret. To be more succinct, if a corporation and/or its associated strategies can be deemed comparable to a cryptographic message maker of the nth order, then what does holder of said corporation and/or corporate strategy do in the event a single message from said device is compromised. In other words, what does holder of said corporation and/or corporate strategy do in the event that the secrets which were and/or are involved with said message are no longer deemed secret? The secret-keeping corporation has two choices if they seek to remain a corporation with a potentially compromised message-maker: it can either create a message-maker that produces messages which are obfuscated by cryptography in such a way that cannot be compromised which, at this point in history, can be deemed unfeasible with enough time and/or effort on the part of the codebreaker *or* said corporation can create a new corporate strategy which incentivizes one or more parties involved (users, stakeholders and/or employees) to keep said secret *secret*, so to speak, lest said stakeholders’ respective proportion of corporate resources become compromised as well.

**A few ground rules**

I’ll take this as an opportunity to lay a few ground rules. For one, there are inherent differences in corporate strategy, where no two strategy holders and, by extension, strategies are exactly the same. Corporate strategies can be cultivated and/or maintained in much the same way conventional definitions of mastery are preceded by experience. Because of this, that which can hinder the practice and/or use of a corporate strategy can be deemed viable or non-viable by a given exchange(s) even if success in designating a known instance of reversal of the effects of a corporate strategy can be deemed plausible in more than one scenario(s) and/or exchange(s). The cryptographic message makers (corporate strategists and/or corporate strategy holders) that are susceptible to such reversals are, as a consequence of this, more likely to undergo compromise as a result of said strategy-reversals, are akin to failures found in conventional cryptographic message makers that have been compromised in some capacity; as though the strategy of said message-maker has undergone a reversal in overall effectiveness.

 

**The basics of corporate strategy change**

In addition, anything that can be deemed as being plausible so as to provoke an incumbent and/or nascent corporate strategy to change and/or remain the same against the will of said corporate strategy holder can be deemed undesirable by said strategist’s shareholders, marketing campaign, exchange, so on so forth. If there are known historical precedents which can chart a path of success between a corporate strategy at time, t, having undergone one of said undesirable hinderances, then invoking one or more of the aforementioned reversals, as potential in their respective chances of success as they may be, can serve the purpose of increasing a corporate strategy’s proximity toward a known equilibrium range that said strategist has at one point regarded as being comparable to or akin to a hospitable zone (a concept in Physics often used to describe the distance from a star a planet has to be in order to sustain Life as it is known at this point in time) so as to partake in controlled equilibrium navigation, as defined earlier, within the metric-time well borne from an exchange, corporation, and/or corporate strategy’s displacement of a common resource (metric) used to evaluate said exchange, corporation, and/or corporate strategy’s success within a given exchange(s).

**The effects of a given metric on corporate strategy**

At certain points, effects borne from a given metric-time well, may reduce the likelihood of a participant (corporation, corporate strategy, and/or exchange which may or may not have its own agency given some programmatically-induced corporate functions) from experiencing any adverse effects associated with a single instance of controlled instance of equilibrium navigation where there can be multiple instances of controlled equilibrium navigation between two points in metric-time (in this scenario defined at two times, t1 and t2); effects which may result in long-lasting effects on a corporate strategist’s strategy writ-large; effects which may affect a participant’s proximity toward an optimal value for a given metric in a negative or positive capacity. An exchange’s effect on the metric-time well instance within metric-time is comparable to, but not the same as, the universal and/or localized effects which said participant may have on the metric-time well that said participant may share with other participants. Put simply, even though participant behavior can be explained and described with nth order differential equations, not every participant has its own agency despite there being observable changes in their behavior where corporate strategies are a prime example of a participant’s potential to lack agency of its own. To be clear, corporations and their respective strategies exist *within* exchanges – public or private; where exchanges can or cannot exist within exchanges specific to them (exchanges which *contain* exchanges, if you will).

**Public-facing corporate strategies**

**Exit strategy:** When corporations don't want their corporate strategy to include a public acknowledgement (press releases, etc.) of why said corporation would leave an exchange, corporation strategy holders must acknowledge, at the very least, that such a corporate action would be made at a cost to shareholders whose investments may be stored within said exchange. Corporations, in an attempt to deal with potential backlash associated with corporate actions of this caliber, may necessitate the use of corporate methods that would potentially decrease the likelihood of shareholder disinterest especially if that disinterest will result in a decreased corporate valuation (among other metrics) and the associated negatives that may come as a result of said corporate actions in addition to corporate action effects on nascent and incumbent shareholder confidence in the exchange unto itself. For example, an exit strategy must allow an organization to achieve corporate strategy escape velocity in order to overcome the fiscal kinematics gravity-equivalent of the nth order associated with incumbent organizations remaining within an exchange which is directly proportional to the fiscal kinematics mass-equivalent associated with the largest exchange and/or organization within the metric-time well that said exchange is either a consequence of or a party to. Corporate strategy escape velocity allows for a corporate strategy (riding on the back of an organization and/or corporation, so to speak) to travel from the pull of a metric-time well to a region of metric-time at which said corporation would no longer be *falling* into a metric-time well’s orbit given the inter and/or intra organizational displacement of a common or specific metric’s magnitude at time, t. To put it plainly, as many corporate strategies are affected by elements of metric-time which may be outside or within a corporation’s control, corporate strategies largely influence corporate action but corporate strategies, via elements of metric-time, some elements falling outside of a corporation’s control, can be influenced by both elements within a corporation’s control and outside of a corporation’s control. That which an organization doesn’t have control over serves the purpose of informing corporate actions with great emphasis considering the uncertainty associated with these aforementioned, uncertain variables; though strategies only have influence over variables at their disposal despite this paradigm.

**Consensus among corporate officers**

Corporate strategies are often subject to the consequences of non-consensus among corporate officers though consensus is not impossible. Exchange-prone corporations are inherently profit-seeking, however, said organizations' definitions of profit can be defined, in part, by said organizations' shareholders, fundamental analysis magnitudes and/or financial statements where shareholder moneys can directly influence corporate actions, moneys that can influence financial statements, financial statements that can influence said corporation's capacity to attract shareholders with those very said financial statements, where the ultimate goal of using those very same shareholder dollars is to increase the efficacy and reach of corporate actions, where corporate actions placate the process at large.

 

 

**Parallels between corporate strategy and cryptography**

By making the rate at which change in a given field value which is associated with a given cryptographic message maker (to the nth order) changes its proximity to achieving cryptographic equilibrium and, as such, the respective cryptographic continuum navigations, which may or may not result from said equilibrium changes as well, a corporate strategist can accommodate the likelihood that said cryptographic message maker would be made akin to a metric-time corporate exchange simulation maker of the nth order, especially in reference to cryptography's relationship to nascent and incumbent corporate strategy at the metric-time scale. In other words, corporate strategies and, by extension, corporation strategy holders and the associated exchanges which they may or may not be a part of, are capable of being compromised much the same way a cryptographic message maker (to the nth order) can be described as having been compromised in the event that its respective messages can no longer fulfill the explicit purpose of concealing the very information which its users seek to conceal.

**Corporate strategy as it pertains to cyclicality and its consequences**

The methodologies employed by corporate strategists and their associated regulatory bodies are cyclical in nature at the micro and macro-economic level and, as such, corporate strategies must be crafted with a level of awareness of said cyclicality in the way corporate strategy holders are to employ and curate said strategies in an exchange if a corporate strategy holder’s intention is to counteract any potential changes which may or may not result as a direct consequence of these cyclical-ready methodologies being at odds with incumbent and nascent corporate strategies currently being employed by said strategists and their associated contemporaries within a metric-time well and the inherent fiscal kinematics gravity-equivalent magnitude which encourages participants, subject to said magnitude, to remain in orbit (so to speak) as a consequence of said magnitude and, as a result, continue to remain subject to said magnitude. For example, there is an inherent level of inertia (or, rather, the fiscal kinematics analog to inertia) associated with a corporation’s desire to both enter and/or leave a given exchange and said exchange’s consequences.

**Cryptographic reconciliation**

Cryptography can be used to reconcile the old physics with the new physics. In much the same way, the results of this reconciliatory effort can undergo a reconciliation of its own when held comparable to Game Theory as it applies to corporate strategy. This means that for every analog in old and new physics, there stands to be a potential analog in the realm of corporate strategy.

Physics

**Corporate strategy introduction dissonance:** corporate strategists and associated participants seek the dissonance borne from nascent strategists joining an exchange and influencing equal but opposite strategy changes in incumbent strategies which are a direct response to said nascent strategy’s introduction into an exchange. For example, when nascent corporate strategies delineate a force of change within an exchange and, as a result, incumbent strategists must adapt their strategies in response to said nascent strategists as a means of decreasing the likelihood of their own strategies’ potential compromise thereby increasing the likelihood of other strategies’ potential compromise as a direct result of this adaptive response, with an emphasis on strategies which do not belong to the very same corporate strategy holders which had to adapt.

Fiscal Kinematics

**Metric-time object:** a metric-time object operates as described with traditional kinematic equations as opposed to the quantum behavior often seen with subatomic particles; it is, by definition, a logical extension of a non-subatomic particle as a result of this distinction. Where a metric-time object is one of the most basic classes of that which is subject to metric-time and metric-time’s consequences; akin to a logical extension of an atom, one of the fundamental building blocks of modern Physics; barring quantum particles, which are smaller in size and are described differently via equations than their non-quantum counterparts. For instance, a metric-time object may be composed of three or more fields at a given time, t, where a 1st (zeroth) order metric (such as P/E ratio, to take a cue from fundamental analysis) would represent the metric’s value at time, t, a 2nd order metric would represent the rate of change of said metric at time, t, and a 3rd order metric would represent the change in said metric’s rate of change at time, t; these three orders akin to position, velocity and acceleration in conventional kinematics. A metric-time object is as much a consequence of its respective fields’ values at time, t and, even more so, a consequence of the 2nd and 3rd order differential equations which can be used to describe the change in said metric at time, t.

**Corporate strategy escape velocity:** the rate of change which a public-facing or stakeholder-facing metric available to a given corporate strategy holder must achieve in order to leave the *pull*, so to speak, of a metric-time well.

**Metric-time object field delta:** in metric-time, instead of there being a static representation of a metric’s value, said value being a representation of a given metric-time object’s instantiation at time, t, there is, instead, a figure associated with the changes in a metric otherwise known as a metric-time object field delta.

**Company success:** companies fail when they aren’t able to adequately reconcile strategy with corporate actions and functions. Companies succeed when they are able to properly navigate metric-time’s influence over their corporate strategies and, ultimately, actions as well. Where an instance of a corporation’s strategy can be defined as the rate at which said corporation’s functions (departments, shareholder relations, etc.) alter a metric which may be known or unknown to a corporation’s external stakeholders. To add, the rate at which said corporation’s functions alter the rate at which a metric’s rate changes, can be involved within the aforementioned strategy. For example, the rate at which an organization’s valuation changes can be deemed conceptually equivalent to velocity in kinematics with regard to metric of valuation, likewise, the rate at which an organization’s rate of valuation changes can be deemed comparable to acceleration in kinematics.

**Metric-time object:** Put more plainly, metric-time objects are defined by rates of change these metrics more so than metric magnitudes themselves. For example, if one is using the metric-time object maker class, one need only identify a given metric from at least two times, t, and t+1 respectively, in order to find a rate of change of the nth order where each order can be represented by a differential equation of equivalent order and, as such, differential behavior, especially as that behavior relates to kinematics. The metrics used in fundamental analysis and financial statements would result in more accurate interpretations of the relevant variables’ magnitude at a given time, t \+ Tdelta, where a metric-time object can be defined with at least three arguments, a force, mass, and acceleration equivalent, each field bearing the fiscal kinematic equivalents of acceleration, velocity and force. The trial and error involved in determining optimum metric-time object initial and desired value trajectories *is* the study of fiscal kinematics. Where each metric-time object, given its own subjectivity and specificity, and, in addition, given the scenarios in which metric-time objects are to be used, can take on a form which can be made to adapt to shifting strengths and weaknesses in an evolving corporate strategy and/or corporate strategy holder. In this scenario, effectively actuated corporate strategies yield necessary corporate actions and, as a result, the delivery and/or publication of corporate fundamentals, statements, and/or marketing campaigns (among other public methods of discourse) which are, by definition, the most pubic facing representations of corporate strategies and said strategies’ consequences. To be clear, corporate actions are exemplifications of corporate strategy and, as a consequence of this, corporate strategies are largely defined by (but not limited to) the corporate actions which stem from their invocations. As a result of this paradigm, corporate actions can be evaluated and corporate strategies deduced by participants (corporate strategies, corporations, and/or exchanges) which are not, in and of themselves, the corporate strategy holders of said corporate strategy which may or may not be the subject of said deduction; the most negative of the potential consequences borne from these communal efforts at corporate strategy invocation being the potential of these corporate strategies to exhibit signs of compromise. Put simply, strategy, as defined by fiscal kinematics, can be defined by the metrics and nth order changes to said metrics which result from attempts to affect alterations to both public-facing and stakeholder-facing metrics in an attempt to increase a strategy holder’s proximity to a known goal whilst accommodating for the unknowns associated with the navigation of metric-time and its consequences including, but not limited to, fiscal kinematics gravity-equivalent constant of the nth order.

**Fiscal kinematics gravity-equivalent:** a metric-time equivalent to gravity and its associated gravitational constants in conventional kinematics.

**Fiscal kinematics force-equivalent:** an analog to force where, in this scenario, an instance of a fiscal kinematics force-equivalent is equal to a metric-object field magnitude at time, t, multiplied by a respective fiscal kinematics gravity-equivalent constant of the nth order, an analog to the gravitational acceleration at any given position in space-time as described by conventional kinematics though it goes without saying that space-time was not known as it is today when kinematics was still a fledgling subject.

**Corporate strategy equilibrium:** this is when cryptography strategies receive reductions in nascent and incumbent heterogeneity so as to increase the likelihood that a message sent (call) by a given cryptographic message maker of the nth order would be received (response) via retroactive deduction. A path can be drawn from the subject of cryptography to the field of corporate strategy with the former as a bridge between the two. For example, when corporate strategies align and, as a consequence of this, are less likely to have each and every aspect of their make-up clearly differentiated when compared to corporate strategies of similar make and model, this resultant increase in the comparable similarities between two or more corporate strategies (*alignment*, if you will) is when cryptographic message makers are more likely to become compromised. In other words, if there is a decrease in the size of the corpus used to describe and actuate corporate strategies, the result are corporate strategies which share this common corpus and, as a result, may or may not be less effective at reducing the likelihood of a given corporate strategy achieving equilibrium and the effects of this.

**Cryptographic code maker and cryptographic code breaker equilibrium dissonance as it pertains to corporate strategy:** Cryptographic message makers of the nth order can avoid finding impetus to achieve cryptographic escape velocity and, as a consequence of this, leave a cryptographic equivalent of a cryptography exchange-equivalent between two or more cryptographic message makers of the nth order after achieving equilibrium (undergoing compromise) as though an unbreakable code were broken without the awareness of the message sender. For example, a corporation that has implemented a corporate strategy to transition from a publicly-traded organization to a privately-held organization and, as a result, the corporate strategy – specific to the corporation in question \- leaves the exchange with said corporation. Cryptography message maker of the nth order that undergoes compromise at a given order must remain compromised within the exchange which dealt and/or administered said compromise as said cryptography message maker of the nth order must undergo strategy change; where there exists a strategy delta, strategist delta and exchange delta at given times, t.

 

Cryptography

**Proximal changes to compromise and its effects:** Every strategy which alters a cryptographic message maker of the nth order’s proximity to compromise has a reciprocal that can stem said reciprocal’s invocation to the result of a cryptographic message maker of the nth order being invoked, akin to the relationship between experimentation and the Universe; the weather and strategy invocation. Processes which are affected by factors that possess enough unknowns so as to warrant the use of a percentage likelihood when utilized in conjunction with the vehicle of prediction and, as such, are often associated with the subsequent behaviors and exhibited qualities associated with the use of percentage likelihood.

**Purpose of cryptography:** cryptography, under normal circumstances, is invoked if the intent is to obfuscate that which one has the intention of hiding from another that can be held subject to said instance of cryptography, particularly one with agency of its own.

**Cryptographic cipher exchange attempt:** where a cryptographic cipher exchange attempt is when at least two cryptographic message makers of the nth order, in an attempt to affect changes to the other message maker’s proximity to being compromised, have the desire to accomplish the task of leaving said cryptographic cipher exchange attempt. For example, when two or more corporations are publicly-traded in the stock market but share a common, publicly-traded parent organization such is the case for corporations like GE Vernova, GE and GE Health.

Computer Science

Metric-time system state can be described as the metric-time system state where all variables within said system state are influenced by or are a consequence of metric-time and its effects on variables subject to metric-time where metric-time is akin to space-time and its associated fabric and analogs herein.
